											<h1>Evil files/Backdoors</h1>
										</header>
										<p> Malware, short for malicious software, is software that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. Usually created by a team of hackers to make money, by selling to the highest bidder on the darkweb. A lot of the time hackers use programs baught over the darkweb, rather than writting the software themselves.</p>
										<p>Typically, malware is delivered through a link or email which requires the user to open the file to execute the malware. However, nowadays you will see hackers have found all sorts of ways to deliver their programs.   Often there is confusion between what virus', worms and malware actually are. Below is a list of differnt forms of malware.</p>

										</header>
									<p>	•   Virus: attach themselves to files and infect other clean files. They keep a low profile in order to stay hidden while they spread. Often waiting for a predefined date before they start to cause damage. They run when a user launches an infected program or even from infected hardware such as disks or USB’s.	</p>
									<P>	•	Trojans: These can appear to be a legitimate program you are downloading. Often you download both the intended program while the evilfile is downloaded in the background. Allowing for backdoors to be created for more malware to be downloaded at a later date.</P>
									<p>	•	<a href="Social Engineering.html#sc">Scareware: </a> Uses aggressive advertisement to convince users to download their program. Often with the appearance of a legitimate virus scanning program to be more convincing.</p>
									<p>   </p>
									<p>•	Ransomware: Will lock down your computer and files. Built with a destructive feature that will erase all data on the device unless a ransom is paid. Often big businesses are the target as apposed to personal attacks. The ransomware "WannaCry" was reponsible for 19,000 NHS appointments being cancelled and costing around £92m. Here is an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/11/wannacry-cyber-attack-cost-nhs-92m-19000-appointments-cancelled/" target="_blank">article </a> for more information. </p>

									<h2>Protection against malware</h2>
									<p>Make sure you’ve got the latest software installed on your device. Updates are there for a reason, in order to patch up any vulnerable areas within the operating system. While it can be annoying to constantly update all your devices, its much safer to do so. A <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Investigation-WannaCry-cyber-attack-and-the-NHS.pdf" target="_blank">report </a> into the last years NHS cyber-attack (WanaCry Ransomware) showed that it was able to spread so quickly due to not managing their firewalls properly.</p>
